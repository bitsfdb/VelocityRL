# VelocityRL 🚀

A powerful, user-friendly tool for performing visual asset swaps in Rocket League.

> **Note**: The NPM package for this tool is named `rl-item-mod`.

## Overview

**VelocityRL** provides an interactive terminal wizard and a premium desktop interface that allows you to swap in-game items (e.g., swapping a standard boost for Alpha Reward). Under the hood, it seamlessly invokes an advanced Python engine to accurately parse `.upk` encryption, perfectly expand Name Table string offsets, and rebuild the package architecture without causing game crashes.

## Features

- **Interactive Wizard**: A beautiful command-line interface to search for and select your source and target items.
- **Python Interop**: Leverages a robust Python backend to handle complex LZO decompression, AES decryption, and binary offset shifting.
- **Automated Backups**: Automatically backs up original game assets before patching, with a one-click CLI restore feature.
- **Item Database**: Uses a built-in `items.json` database for fuzzy-searching and mapping in-game item names directly to their underlying UPK files.

## ⚠️ Warning - Some Swaps Will Crash the Game

> **Swapping certain asset types is not yet fully supported and will cause Rocket League to crash on load.** This is a known limitation of the current version and is being worked on. Until a fix is released, avoid swapping the following:

> Thumbnails in general cause a lot of crashes, as well as bodies and goal explosions.

> If a swap you attempt causes a crash, you should validate game files, and when a crash occurs on an item use the **Restore backups** as shown in this screenshot
